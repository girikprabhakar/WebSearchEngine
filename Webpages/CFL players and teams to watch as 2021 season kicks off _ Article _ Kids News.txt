The first CFL game of the 2021 season kicks off on Aug. 5. The 2020 season was cancelled due to COVID-19 restrictions. The new season has already been delayed and it includes fewer games. But there will be fans in the stands! Arjun flags the teams and players to watch. ?? ?? ?? It’s been a while for CFL fans, but as the saying goes, “Better late than never!” The Canadian Football League is set to return on Aug. 5, when the Winnipeg Blue Bombers host the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. That’s two months later than planned and there will be fewer games than usual. But that’s still a step up from 2020 when the entire season was cancelled because of COVID-19. Before the new season begins, here are five things you need to know: 1. Why was the 2021 season delayed? When the COVID-19 pandemic started, training camps were cancelled and the start date for the 2020 season was pushed. Then, in August 2020, CFL Commissioner Randy Ambrosie announced the season wasn’t going to happen at all. ‘That sucks’: Teen football fan reacts after CFL cancels season In November 2020, the CFL unveiled its 2021 schedule, with a plan to start the regular season on June 10, 2021. After a meeting in April 2021, however, the CFL’s board of governors announced it was delaying the new season again due to ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, this time until Aug. 5. Now, after a long process of cancellations and postponements, the CFL season is finally underway. The 2021 Grey Cup is set to happen at the Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, Ontario.

How many games will there be? Because of the delayed start to the season, there will only be 14 games instead of 18. The Grey Cup final will also be played later than originally scheduled, on Dec. 12 instead of Nov. 21. 2019 Grey Cup touches down and kid fans are ready The event marks the 11th time the Grey Cup will be played in Hamilton, Ontario, but the first time it will be played at the Tim Hortons Field, which opened in 2014. According to CFL Commissioner Randy Ambrosie, the league relies on ticket sales to survive. Fans, like these Winnipeggers celebrating their Grey Cup win in 2019, will be allowed in the stands this season. (Image credit: John Woods/The Canadian Press) 3. Will there be fans? Yes. At this point, fans will be allowed to attend games. This is key to the success of the season for a few reasons. POLL — Mascots alone in stands. Which one looks loneliest? The CFL is dependent on ticket sales for survival. Ambrosie has said that having fans in the stands accounts for at least half of the money the league makes in a season. Decisions about COVID-19 restrictions depend on the venue and the province. At the IG Field in Winnipeg, for example, anyone 12 or older needs to show proof that they’ve been vaccinated in order to get in. 4. What are the teams to watch? Out of the nine CFL teams, here are the ones that analysts say have the best chance of hoisting the Grey Cup: Winnipeg Blue Bombers: The defending champions are back at full strength, re-signing the majority of their key players. Manitoba’s team will be looking for a repeat as Grey Cup champions. Hamilton Tiger-Cats: It’s all about redemption for the Ticats this season. After a Grey Cup upset against the Bombers in 2019, they’ll be looking to end a 22-year Grey Cup drought in Hamilton.  Saskatchewan Roughriders: The Riders were close to making the Grey Cup final in 2019, but couldn’t close it out. Now’s their chance, and with an offence like theirs, Saskatchewan will be dangerous. Q&A ? Meet Canada’s first female junior football player 5. Who are the players to watch?

At 34, he’s coming off one of his best seasons yet, posting 1,380 yards in 2019. He came up big in the final for the Bombers in 2019, and will be an integral part of their team this year.

He threw 4,302 yards and brought the team all the way to the West Division finals. Fajardo is poised to build on his exceptional play from 2019 during the 2021 season. What’s next? On Tuesday, the league announced its plan for what to do if games have to be cancelled due to COVID-19. Cancellations are possible, but let’s hope we witness the battle for the Grey Cup!
