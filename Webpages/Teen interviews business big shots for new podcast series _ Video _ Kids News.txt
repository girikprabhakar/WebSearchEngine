CBC Kids News contributor Campbell Baron has launched a new project called The Ones Who Succeed. It’s a series of video and audio podcasts featuring interviews with entrepreneurs (or business owners) from across North America. The Toronto teen, who turns 16 on Jan. 21, said the point of the 13-episode series, which officially launched on Jan. 15, was to inspire more kids to get into business, even if their projects don’t work out. “We often feel like failing is a negative thing,” Baron said, but “oftentimes, it’s a learning experience.” “Nobody wants to see their company fail, but if it fails, it’s really about getting up after the failure” and trying again, he said. That’s what it takes to become one of the ones who succeed, Baron said. Michael Dubin, founder and CEO of the Dollar Shave Club, speaks with Toronto teen Campbell Baron. (Submitted by Campbell Baron) He put that lesson to the test in trying to line up one of his guests, U.S. investor Chris Sacca. Sacca appeared on ABC’s Shark Tank, the American equivalent of CBC’s Dragons’ Den, which is a TV show that gives people the chance to pitch business ideas. Baron estimates he sent between 80 and 100 emails to try and get the high-profile guest to agree to be interviewed. It worked. Baron remembers sitting at his kitchen table when the email reply from Sacca finally came through. “My hands just start shaking,” Baron said. “I was super excited.” Second season underway Baron also managed to line up a corporate sponsor to help pay for his flights, hotel rooms and equipment. With one of his parents in tow, he travelled to places like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York to record his interviews. A new episode of the podcast will publish each Tuesday until the spring and Baron said he’s already working on a second season. So, how does he balance reporting for CBC Kids News with a new podcast, not to mention normal kid stuff, like school? Baron said it all comes down to working hard, and then working even harder.
