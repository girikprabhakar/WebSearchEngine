Now imagine not having the proper gear if you lived in the North, where winter has already started and the average temperature in February hovers around –30 C. That’s the reality some kids in Arctic Bay, Nunavut, were facing when a Canadian actor made a generous donation. Ryan Reynolds responded to a call on Twitter requesting donations of winter gear for kids from the tiny community where snow is in the forecast today. Overall more than 300 kids from a community of about 1,000 received donations of winter gear.

She had reached out to the school to see if they needed school supplies. “Some kids don't have the proper gear,” said the school’s principal, Gregg Durrant. “We have kids among us who really didn't have enough.” So Han put out this tweet: It wasn’t long before Reynolds reached out to her directly asking how he could help. “I was just touched,” Han said in an interview with CBC. “I was grateful that, you know, people are listening and he wanted to help out. And that he has concern over Inuit in Nunavut.” Becky Han is an Innuk singer-songwriter originally from Arctic Bay who now lives in Saskatchewan.

Canada Goose is a Canadian company that makes expensive luxury winter gear. A sample of the items donated. According to its website, kids’ parkas at Canada Goose cost $750 and snow pants cost $450.

In the end, 329 kids have benefited from the donations. CBC Kids News reached out to Ryan Reynolds for comment but has not heard back.
